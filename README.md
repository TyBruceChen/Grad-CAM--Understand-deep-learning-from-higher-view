# Grad-CAM--Understand-deep-learning-from-higher-view
Gradient Class Activation Map: Visualize the model's prediction and can help you understand neural network models better

Thanks to Selvaraju's research: [Grad-CAM: Visual Explanations from Deep Networks via Gradient-based Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02391)

This repository realizes Grad-CAM with Pytorch and Pytorch based models (pretrained models are from timm)
